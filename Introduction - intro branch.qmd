## Introduction

(Why Lego data?\
How is it reported?\
What is the most popular Lego set?)


1. Lego, originating from Denmark, was officially founded in the year 1934 by Ole Kirk Christiansen and is one of the world’s most iconic toy companies. 
2. Initially Christiansen was a carpenter who was making wooden toys but as time passed by, he adapted to Kiddi-craft(Self blocking Bricks) and then automatic binding bricks were invented. 
3. Over the years, Lego has expanded the production line vastly by producing theme based Lego-sets like Star-wars, Harry Potter, Marvel etc... and the very first store to open anywhere in the world was in Sydney, Australia, in the year 1984.
4. (Currently, the most biggest Lego set available is the world map set consisting of 11,695 pieces and there are much more sets like these which really keeps you occupied.).
5. Even though Lego stopped patent for Lego bricks a long time ago, its competitors could not stand a chance in the toy-construction market for example Lego sued the CoCo Toy Company for copyright infringement and the company has to cease manufacture of the products.
6. (And when we talk about availability of products and customer satisfaction, Inventory management is a key strength for LEGO. It ensures that popular themes are available to meet demand while efficiently handling production and supply chains.). 
7. The source for the dataset is TidyTuesday and this community has taken the liberty to aggregate that year’s releases into a publicly available dataset with the help of Rebrickable, who maintains and updates the Lego Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set.
8. Beyond physical bricks, LEGO has expanded into digital games like LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Fortnite, movies, TV series, and the LEGO Ideas community platform.
9. The methodology includes exploring of the vast data, combinnig data-sets and also includes graphs to understand about themes of Lego set and gives complexity of LEGO from the beginning till date.

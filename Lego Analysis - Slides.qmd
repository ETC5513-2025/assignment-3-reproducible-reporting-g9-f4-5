#### Introduction

**Origins & Innovation** - Founded in Billund, Denmark (1934) by Ole Kirk Christiansen, LEGO evolved from wooden toys to patented self-blocking bricks in the 1950s after getting introduced to Kiddi-craft also know as Self blocking Bricks.

**Our Approach** - Using the 2022 TidyTuesday dataset via Rebrickable, we clean and aggregate metadata, then visualize theme release trends, parts set complexity and trends in colour complexity.

**Global Expansion** - Lego’s portfolio includes licensed themes and its first store open in Sydney (1984); the largest set now contains 11,695 pieces World Map and suprisingly the most colour used in this theme is white.

**Brand Diversification** - Beyond bricks, Lego also entered digital games like LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Fortnite and even movies, TV series.

### Discussion

Based on @fig-most_popular and @fig-least_popular, it can be seen that the more popular themes have on average significantly fewer parts in comparison to the least popular themes. This indicates that accessibility, simplicity, and recognizability may play a more important role in determining a theme's success, rather than set complexity alone. Simpler sets can appeal to more customers, especially younger children and first time taster, making them more commercially successful.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Creating correlation dataframe
theme_correlation = set_themes |> 
  group_by(theme_name) |>
  summarize(n_sets = n(), 
            median_parts = median(num_parts, na.rm = TRUE), 
            .groups = "drop")|>
  filter(!is.na(median_parts))

# Calculate correlation
correlation_result = cor(theme_correlation$n_sets, 
                         theme_correlation$median_parts, 
                         method = "pearson")
correlation_result
```

However, the correlation analysis between the number of sets in each theme and the median number of parts per set produced a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.08. This indicates a very weak negative correlation, meaning there is little to no linear relationship between a theme's popularity (number of sets) and the complexity of its sets (median parts count). In other words, while popular themes often feature smaller sets, the number of sets in a theme does not strongly predict the typical complexity of those sets. In terms of inventory management, the production of simple sets within existing themes can help to boost sales.

Overall, the finding is aimed to emphasize that simplicity and accessibility are key factors of Lego theme popularity.
